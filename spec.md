# Textbook Specification: Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## 1. Title
"Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics"

## 2. Purpose and Scope
This textbook aims to provide a comprehensive, university-level introduction to the interdisciplinary fields of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. It covers fundamental theoretical concepts, practical applications, and emerging research areas, suitable for both upper-undergraduate and graduate students. The scope includes robot perception, actuation, control systems, kinematics, dynamics, and learning-based approaches, with a strong emphasis on humanoid systems. The goal is to equip students with the knowledge and tools necessary to understand, design, and implement intelligent robotic systems that interact with the physical world.

## 3. Target Audience
Upper-undergraduate and graduate students in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, and related fields. Assumes a foundational understanding of calculus, linear algebra, and basic programming concepts.

## 4. Required Chapter Format Template
All chapters must follow this consistent structure:
1. Chapter Introduction
2. Learning Objectives
3. Key Concepts
4. Step-by-step teaching explanation
5. Math + equations (if relevant)
6. Examples
7. Diagrams (ASCII or described, with title, caption, and teaching notes)
8. One Lab Module (per chapter, with objective, theory, background, materials, instructions, code template, expected results, rubric)
9. Summary
10. 8-12 Problem-set questions
11. Instructor Notes

## 5. Writing Style Guidelines
- **Tone:** Academic, authoritative, clear, concise, and engaging.
- **Formality:** Formal, suitable for a university textbook.
- **Readability:** Accessible to students with the specified background, avoiding overly complex jargon without explanation.
- **Consistency:** Maintain consistent terminology, formatting, and citation style throughout the book.
- **Engagement:** Encourage critical thinking and practical application through examples, labs, and problem sets.

## 6. Required Elements per Chapter
- **Introduction:** Briefly set the stage for the chapter's content and its relevance.
- **Learning Objectives:** Clearly state what students should be able to understand or do after completing the chapter.
- **Core Concepts:** Define and explain the essential ideas, theories, and principles.
- **Step-by-step teaching explanation:** Provide clear, logical explanations of topics.
